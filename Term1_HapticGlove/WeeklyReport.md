# Project Weeks 6 - 9

## Week 6 (02/12/2019)
##### During the early weeks of the brief being provided, I originally wanted to work on a haptic feedback vest however, I struggled to find a way to implement enough inputs to meet the required brief.

## Week 7 (09/12/2019)
##### I then went away and came back the following week with another Idea I had toyed with, of making a small game using LED lights, but had the same problem but instead the opposite of needing more outputs. 

## Week 8 (16/12/2019)
##### I felt like I was close to an idea that I wanted to pursue which is when I decided to finally go towards building a glove using inspiration, I had obtained from trying to think about the haptic vest. I had also seen some pictures of robot hands and decided to try and build a haptic feedback glove which would function within the Unity Game Engine.
##### I then started to try and think about how I would connect everything, looking into how other people had done similar things but on simple solutions using foam hands with some motors controlling string to bend the hands. 

## Week 9 – 10 (16/12/2019 - 23/12/2019)
##### I would use this concept to think about moving my 3D model hand by using invisible like strings to control the true or false statements via a base threshold.
##### I then looked into the prices of the equipment required and how long it would take for them to arrive. This was important as I knew that personally, I needed to be able to build something interesting but, on a budget, due to personal limitations. I then happened to see that Flex Sensors were at a reasonably high price in comparison to other components. This is when I started to look for alternatives and found a guide on how to build your own budgeted versions of flex sensors.
