# Lab 00

I was tasked with setting up two different types of circuits for LED's

first being a Serial Circuit and the second being a Parallel Circuit. 



#### Serial Circuit

This circuit only fully powered upto two LED's and barely managed to power a third.

This is because the power was being passed directly from the positive and through each LED which acted as a resistance.

As shown below once you reach the third LED the lights are dimmed and struggling to share power.

#### Parallel
As shown below you can see how much more LED's you can potentially run by using a parallel circuit by constantly running the LED's back to the power source.

# Lab 01
I struggled to get the serial data to work using a finate state machine this is due to my lack of experience coding in C++ and will be what I learn to improve next.

This felt incredibly frustrating as this is such as simple task in which I am unable to achieve due to a lack of knowledge of the syntax.

I then also struggled with this task of getting the motion sensor operating using my own code so I used the source code,
on the information web-page for the motion sensor to be able to test if I successfully build the circuit correctly.
