# WEEK 1 PROJECT REPORT

## 

Weekly Overview:


This week I have been looking into how other companies and individuals have approached haptic feedback through gameplay, I understand that I won’t be completely following them. However, having a form of inspiration on how to approach the hardware is always beneficial.
I also decided that because I am lacking inputs that I would instead change the “gameplay” elements to involve the player (as in the user) to take damage and then they will press an input button on each part of the haptic vest to then provide health back. 
Each action will then relay a different amount of feedback through using vibration. The use for this hardware would be to reduce the need for UI in virtual reality games and more focusing on the aspect of keeping the player’s mental and physical presence within the game-world space. Preventing the player’s feeling of immersion from being broken.


Weekly Constraints:


I currently need to consider how I will be wiring up the motors to one another to form a vest like device. This will include so far the Button for each area to provide the “healing” input for the player, this however doesn’t need to be limited to being just used for a basic heal however due to technical time constraints I would like to most effectively demo the hardware. 
I must then consider and ask for advice on whether this project is viable and if so, how should I best improve the design of the overall product itself?
Affordability, I need to carefully look into how much parts for the product will cost and if I’m capable of sourcing them from university. This is what I will check off by the end of Monday’s session after discussing the product further.

Considerations:


I had to make some technical considerations for potential limitations such as not having access to a VR headset and failing the requirement of demonstrating the product in class, thus I opted to design the vest in a way in which I can present it directly to the class through the monitor with the intention of it being ported to VR as a final product. 
If I have enough time and money, then I will consider making glove variants also to provide feedback similar to a console controller. However, this might be too big in scope and will only add onto the product if viable.
